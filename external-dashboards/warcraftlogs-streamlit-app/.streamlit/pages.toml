# Define the order in which Streamlit pages should appear in the sidebar.
# Without a pages.toml file, Streamlit orders pages alphabetically by file name.
# This configuration ensures the pages appear in a logical flow: home
# overview first, then damage statistics, healing statistics, deaths, and players.

# The path is relative to the root of the Streamlit app (external‑dashboards/warcraftlogs‑streamlit‑app).
# The name field controls the label shown in the sidebar.
